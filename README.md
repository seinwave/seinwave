## Hi, I'm Matt Seidholz ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer in Brooklyn. I like **React**, I like **Rails**, I like it when a product does what it's supposed to do - and looks good doing it. The front end is my "happy place", but over the last 5 years, my work has seen me all over the stack. Right now, I'm taking a professional sabbatical at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), which I think might be the best decision of my professional life. 
 
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: the finer points of Rails and data modeling
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on: [Smell The Roses](https://github.com/seinwave/smell-the-roses) - an interactive map for the rose gardens at BBG.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: judo, plants, puppy-raising,
